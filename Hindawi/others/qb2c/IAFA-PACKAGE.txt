Title:          qb2c

Version:        3.43 17.Nov 1999

Description:    QB2C is a package which enables execution of BASIC programs 
                under UNIX provided that a C compiler is available on the 
                system. It allows for mixing of BASIC and C code in a single
                file/program as well as usage of X11 based graphics. The
                graphics in QB2C is extended to handle up to 16 X11 graphic
                windows at a time. QB2C is built around the QuickBASIC-to-C 
                translator (qb2c) which translates BASIC code into C code. 
                Scripts 'brun' (to run directly BASIC programs) and 'bcc' 
                (to compile BASIC program and produce an executable) are also 
                provided in order to make life easier.

Platforms:      QB2C is tested under following OS's: OSF1 (DEC alpha UNIX)
                Linux, Sun-OS and HP-UX, IBM AIX. Source files are in
                ANSI C and need to be compiled with options which support
                ANSI standard.

Copying-Policy: "Freely Redistributable". You can mess with the program as 
                you like, but please, do cite the name of the first author
                if you are going to distribute your version. I'd also like
                to hear from anyone who has made a nice program using QB2C.
